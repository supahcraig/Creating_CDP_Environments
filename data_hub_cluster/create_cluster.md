# Creating a Data Hub Cluster in CDP


1. Click Create Data Hub button
2. Select your environment
3. Select a cluster definition

You can either enable/disable auto-scaling, and the default advanced options are most likely fine.

The amount of time it takes to provision the cluster depends on the cluster definition you're using.
